Issue with Uipath: Add Queue Item activity - The operation has timed out
Maybe the solution is downgrading your Uipath.System.Activities package to version 20.4.0, not the latest version. Your add queue item command should work when you do this, provided your workflow is correct. Let me know :slight_smile:
